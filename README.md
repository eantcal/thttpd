TinyHttpServer is a portable tiny HTTP server implementation written in C++11 (you may compile it using either MS Visual Studio or GNU GCC) 

It is capable to serve multiple clients supporting GET method. 
It has been designed mainly for educational purposes for C++ developers that can deal with a non-trivial example of C++11 programming.

It can be compiled for both Windows and Linux operating systems (and maybe others).
